	abstract = {As noise traders affect stock market by trading, sentiment, as a signal of noise, may have relationships with trading volume. This paper explores the effect of sentiment on the stock market’s trading volume. Increase in Volatility Index (VIX) can explain the percentage increase in trading volume, but only in high VIX period. Besides, higher level of VIX is likely to be associated with greater variability of trading volume. The noise traders add liquidity to the market and provide more chances for investors to time their trade as the volatility of liquidity increases. These two kinds of impact lower rational investors’ required return. The noise traders not only drive the price deviating from fundamental value, but also influence the liquidity dimensions.},

Specifically, we examine the influence of investor sentiment on the probability of stock market crises. We find that investor sentiment increases the probability of occurrence of stock market crises within a one-year horizon. The impact of investor sentiment on stock markets is more pronounced in countries that are culturally more prone to herd-like behavior, overreaction and low institutional involvement.},

	abstract = {Recent hydro-meteorological disasters have sparked popular interest in climate change and its role in driving these events. In this paper, we focus on the information provided by one such type of disaster, hurricanes, to capital markets. Because carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are the primary contributor to greenhouse gas concentrations, and their reduction is key to any climate change mitigation strategy, we focus on energy companies. We estimate the reaction of the stock market returns of the largest energy companies in the United States to the most notorious, economically damaging hurricanes in the North Atlantic Ocean in each of the last four decades prior to the Paris Agreement: Hugo (1989), Andrew (1992), Katrina (2005), and Sandy (2012). The event study analysis shows that the impacts are not large, but they are significantly different from zero. Further regression analysis shows that the impacts differ across energy companies based on their carbon intensity; firms with cleaner fuel mixes experienced positive cumulative excess returns relative to coal, and the difference is the largest and most persistent for renewable stocks.},
