<h2> DJIA Data, Yahoo Finance</h2>

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/history?p=%255EDJI

Financial data from the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Data includes the open and close of stock prices for each day, as well as the highest and lowest price recorded for the day. These indices are widely used and will be a relevant outcome variable for the project to study.




<h2> VIX Data, Yahoo Finance</h2>

The Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) VIX index is a widely-used tool to measure investor sentiment. The indicator itself represents the degree of volatility perceived by investors in the next month. It ranges from near zero up to about 60 in recent years, with scores at different intervals representing different levels of perceived volatility.



<h2> Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warning Reports, NOAA</h2>

https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/TCR_StormReportsIndex.xml

NOAA maintains records on each hurricane and tropical storm warning they send out for both the Atlantic and the Pacific. While a wealth of data, including GIS data, is available on NOAAâ€™s website, not all of it is machine readable. As such, I chose the data linked above, which is an XML file that contains the names and dates of every hurricane and tropical storm in the Atlantic and Pacific since 1994. 

<h2> Wildfire Data, Independent Researchers</h2>

This dataset was gathered meticulously and over several iterations to include all wildfires in the United States from the 1800s to present. It includes many types of data about each wildfire, such as the cause and start date, as well as polygons of the area burned. 



<h2> Federal Funds Effective Rate, FRED</h2>

The federal funds effective rate, provided here by FRED of the St. Louis Fed, measures the effective rate that financial institutions are paying to eachother overnight. The federal funds rate depends on the target federal funds rate, which is set as a matter of monetary policy, and which is used as the basis for government intervention to raise or lower the effective rate until it matches the target rate.


<h2> All Non-Farm Employee Payrolls, FRED </h2>

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS

This data measures formal employment in the US economy. The non-farm distinction is a common one to make with payrolls, as farms employ a great deal of seasonal labor. Such metrics are closely watched by investors, which is what makes them interesting, as the monthly release of numbers has a clear and immediate impact on stock market prices. Numbers are sometimes revised later, after their initial release.
