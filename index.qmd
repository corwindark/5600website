Hi Everyone, I am Corwin Dark and I am a first year master's student in the Data Science and Analytics Program here at Georgetown. I grew up in Seattle, Washington before coming to DC for university. I attended American University for my undergraduate degree, which was in international relations. After graduating during COVID, I worked for a small consulting firm on data-related topics for international development programs. After a few years of working, I realized I had a strong curiosity to learn more about cutting edge data science methods, and so I have come back to school. Within data science, I am really interested in how algorithms and techniques can be combined to perform better than they would alone, which is why I really enjoyed creating this project for class and drawing on so many different techniques. I am super excited to be in the Georgetown program with you all, and I hope you enjoy my portfolio! [Start reading with the introduction here.](./Introduction.qmd)
