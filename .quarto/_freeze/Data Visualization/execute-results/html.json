As such the following visualizations will explore this subject in different areas. To start with, let's define the outcome variables in question:\n\nFor each security: S&P 500, QQQ Pro-Shares ETF, and Russell 200 index, we have several metrics\n1. Price\n2. Standard deviation (10 day window)\n3. True range (intraday difference between highest and lowest price/previous closing value)\n4. Trading volume\n\nThe window of our investigation is January 1st 2021 - September 30th 2023.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nv ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   0.3.4\nv tibble  3.2.1     v dplyr   1.1.2\nv tidyr   1.2.0     v stringr 1.4.0\nv readr   2.1.2     v forcats 0.5.1\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(quantmod)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: xts\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: zoo\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\n######################### Warning from 'xts' package ##########################\n#                                                                             #\n# The dplyr lag() function breaks how base R's lag() function is supposed to  #\n# work, which breaks lag(my_xts).

However, we can also see again that volatility is not even between them, with SPY and IWM having higher daily ranges than QQQ on average (at least according to the naked eye).\n\n\nNow, let's review
