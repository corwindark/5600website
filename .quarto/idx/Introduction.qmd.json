By volatility, I specifically mean the intraday range in prices that these indices take on the open market. I will both review these intraday ranges as univariate time series, and also attempt to shed light on variables that impact volatility by incorporating external factors.

While the stock market is often seen as exclusive to a small circle of elite investors, in reality millions of Americans have exposure to the markets through retirement funds, which are made up of many different kinds of investments. If we can become better at predicting the course of financial markets, particularly in relation to external forces like climate change, it could promise to reduce volatility and inefficiency in the market. In turn, this would help everyday people build up their savings to enjoy a better quality of life, retire sooner, and have more financial security. \n\nFurther, understanding the movements of financial markets is important in controlling sentiment amongst investors. In cases like the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, stock market crashes could snowball into businesses cutting more jobs than needed, which could directly impact peoples’ livelihoods.

Related values such as intraday range are also expected to be difficult to predict with any accuracy (given that any such prediction could yield profit and should be closed under the efficient market hypothesis). \n\nFirst, looking at intraday volatility as univariate time series. Conceptually, this means studying the securities in a vacumn, and assuming no external information will determine their future while. While this approach might seem naive, it actually mirrors how some financial institutions might manage risk, where you look to a stocks past volatility to determine future volatility. \n\nSecond, understanding intraday volatility as a series of values which are reflective of individuals actions and preferences. In this case, the individuals in question are investors, and we will look at investor sentiment and see how it might affect prices in financial markets.\n\nThird, viewing intraday volatility in the context of external stimuli. From this analytical perspective, the stock market is a closed system, which is disrupted by external forces from time-to-time that cause unexpected behaviour. Studying the impact of extreme weather events and work stoppages relate to this point.\n\nFourth, understanding intraday volatility as an output variable of larger expectations in the financial system. By looking at changes in future bond prices (i.e. predictions for future bond rates), we can understand how indices react to shifting financial conditions overall.\n\n## Literature Review:\n\nMany of the factors this project seeks to investigate have previously been reviewed by academics. For instance, the consequence of investor sentiment on the stock market has been widely studied, in terms of how it impacts stock market crises [@zouaoui_how_2011], trading volume [@so_relationship_2015], and especially returns [@smales_importance_2017]. Further, authors have previously found an impact of climate events, such as hurricanes [@liu_hurricanes_2021] on stock prices of particular companies. The fact that these issues have been studied previously is encouraging, because in each case the authors chose a specific group of time and company limited stock market data. This project might extend their results to other stock market datasets, and might hope to incorporate these relationships into new statistical models.\n\n\n## Guiding Questions:\n\n1. Is the intraday volatility of major stock indices truly random, or does it contain patterns that can be modelled?\n2.
